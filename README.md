# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Twitter-Tweets
Sentiment analysis, also referred to as opinion mining, is an approach to natural language
processing (NLP) that identifies the emotional tone behind a body of text. This is a popular
way for organizations to determine and categorize opinions about a product, service, or idea.

Sentiment analysis involves the use of data mining, machine learning (ML), artificial
intelligence, and computational linguistics to mine text for sentiment and subjective
information, such as whether it is expressing positive, negative, or neutral feelings.
Sentiment analysis systems help organizations gather insights into real-time customer
sentiment, customer experience, and brand reputation. Generally, these tools use text
analytics to analyze online sources such as emails, online reviews, news, survey responses,
tweets, and comments.

In this work, we are performing a type of sentiment analysis called the “Emotion Detection
Analysis,” which identifies emotions rather than positivity and negativity. Examples include
happiness, frustration, shock, anger, and sadness.

#### In this project, I've performed sentiment analysis on a sample dataset of 10,000 tweets using Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes algorithms, achieving an accuracy rate of 85% and 80%, respectively. Also developed a customized dictionary of emoticons and their corresponding emotions to accurately detect emotions in tweets, resulting in an overall accuracy rate of 90%.
